POINT OF SALE (POS) SYSTEM
---------------------------

PROGRAM OVERVIEW:
This is a Point of Sale (POS) System that allows users to manage product sales, including:
- Viewing a product catalog with prices and stock levels.
- Adding products to a shopping cart.
- Processing transactions and updating stock.
- Providing a simple interface for managing sales.

---------------------------

HOW TO RUN:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the program.
5. Run the program using the command:
   python James.Mills.Walsh-POS_Program-ITT103-SP2025.py

---------------------------

REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS:
- Modify the `products` dictionary to update prices or add new items.
- Implement a database instead of a static dictionary for persistent storage.
- Enhance the user interface with a graphical interface (GUI).
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.

---------------------------

ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS:
- The program assumes that users input correct product names (case-sensitive).
- Stock is manually set in the code and does not persist after the program exits.
- The system currently supports a single transaction at a time.
- Future enhancements may include user authentication and transaction history tracking.
